# Overview

This package is a claim on the preoccupied namespace.


## Reasoning

Namespace claims are part of the suggested pattern from [PEP-0423].

[PEP-0423]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0423

I have been guilty in the past of polluting the top-level namespace
with experimental projects that are only there to satisfy my own
curiosity. This namespace is an attempt to correct that.

In addition to utilizing this namespace for personal one-off projects
in the future, I will also be re-homing some existing projects. Some
candidates for the preoccupied namespace are:

* [python-mapbind](https://github.com/obriencj/python-mapbind)
* [python-brine](https://github.com/obriencj/python-brine)
* [python-livelocals](https://github.com/obriencj/python-livelocals)
* [python-promises](https://github.com/obriencj/python-promises)
* [python-values](https://github.com/obriencj/python-values)
* [python-withscope](https://github.com/obriencj/python-withscope)
